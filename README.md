# Crop Yield Prediction Using Machine Learning
## Introduction

While machine learning algorithms has been used in many fields the researchers in weather and climate 
applications have just recently started to take advantage of powerful ML algorithms. One of the interesting 
topics is to predict the crop production yield with the meteorological variables. Although there have been 
several applications of similar models for highly localized areas it would be very informative to build
predictive models for large geographical scales, such as for a state. Such models would be helpful for 
developing climate change adaptation strategies for agriculture. 

Weather and climate are among the most important factors that affect agriculture especially crop 
production. There is no question that a long warm and dry spell would cause a stress on crops and possibly 
reduce the yield on harvest for many products. Similarly freezing weather or very heavy rain that cause 
runoff during growing season could possibly damage the seeds or the plants after emerging. There are 
several other weather events/conditions, some with obvious positive or negative effect and some with a net 
effect which depends on when and where they happen, and which product is planted. However, even 
considering the obvious factors, building a successful statistical model for crop yield is challenging to say the 
least. This is because, the agro-climatic indicators are highly correlated while most of the machine learning 
algorithms requires non-collinearity. Moreover, finding a long enough measurement for crop yield and the 
climate variables for building a model using ML algorithms is difficult. This is especially true for large scale 
modelling. 

Therefore, the question is whether building a reliable, large scale crop production yield model is possible with 
the currently available yield and agro-climatic data sets? Here in this project, despite all these challenges, I 
will try to build predictive models to answer this question.
